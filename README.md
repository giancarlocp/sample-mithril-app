# sample-mithril-app - a versatile template creating mithril app
[![npm package](https://nodei.co/npm/sample-mithril-app.png?downloads=true&downloadRank=true&stars=true)](https://nodei.co/npm/sample-mithril-app/)


## Purpose

I created this project to build a robust and versatile mithril.js template that can be cloned when we start a new mithril.js project. It is set up with webpack and webpack-dev-server to streamline development and build. A modified version of this template is used by [`create-mithril-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-mithril-app).

## Development

As this template is improved, it will benefit all the future projects based on it.
